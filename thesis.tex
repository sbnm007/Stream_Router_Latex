Modern web applications increasingly demand ultra-low-latency, multiplexed, and secure transport between browsers and cloud-native back-ends. While the QUIC transport protocol \cite{rfc9000} and its application-layer companion HTTP/3 \cite{rfc9114} eliminate head-of-line blocking and reduce handshake latency, current Kubernetes ingress controllers and reverse proxies only provide coarse-grained, connection-level load balancing. They terminate QUIC early and forward traffic over HTTP/1.1, losing the ability to route or observe individual WebTransport streamsâ€”a limitation that severely hampers real-time use cases such as interactive video, gaming, and telemetry.

This dissertation presents Custom Router Proxy, a novel WebTransport-aware proxy that operates natively inside Kubernetes \cite{kubernetes-docs}. By extending the Aioquic library \cite{aioquic-repo}, the custom router intercepts incoming QUIC packets, demultiplexes WebTransport streams containing audio, video, chat, or file data, and forwards each streamâ€”via configuration-driven rulesâ€”to dedicated micro-services that publish processed results into Apache Pulsar topics \cite{pulsar-helm-repo}. The architecture leverages a 32-byte application header embedded in each stream to enable content-based routing at line rate while preserving end-to-end encryption.

Evaluation on a single-node Minikube cluster \cite{minikube-docs} demonstrates that the Router sustains sub-millisecond latency, linear throughput scaling up to five concurrent clients, and zero packet loss even under 90\% fragmentation. The system is fully declarative: routing rules and broker endpoints are supplied through Kubernetes ConfigMaps that support hot-reloading without service restarts. These results validate the feasibility of stream-level, QUIC-native ingress and establish a reusable foundation for deploying next-generation, real-time applications on Kubernetes.
